There is a direct relationship between the lenght of the password and how long it took to crack it. The algorithm is running in 16*C(72,16)*n time, which is unbelievably slow. It is, for all intents and purposes, intractable, and therefore not a feasible method of cracking passwords, at least at this moment in time. 

There are two faster ways that immediately jump out at you - do a dictionary attack with common substitutions, so that you aren't trying random combinations of letters (such as bns80dn) that people are not likely to use as passwords, or to get a list of most commonly used passwords and hash and use those first. From there you can continue with brute force, as you have already greatly increased your chances of finding the password by checking it against some of the most common passwords (RockYou password dump would be great for this).
